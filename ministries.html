						<u><hi><h3>EVANGELISM MINISTRY</h3></hi></u>
	
						<P>
							This is the evangelistic wing of the Church. It meets on Thursdays.

							This Ministry undertakes gospel rallies, crusades, conventions, house-to-house evangelism, 
							and other forms of evangelism, etc.

							These include preaching, witnessing, winning and discipling souls, and encouraging 
							church members to participate in the programmes and activities of the Church and to further
							expose them to the various ministries within the Church. It affords members of the Church the 
							opportunity to plan and organize programmes and activities for evangelism in villages,
							towns and cities and other specialised evangelism- related ministries.
							The Chairman indicated that Jesus in praying for the Church before His departure prayed that the Church will be sanctified by the truth (Jn. 17:17). This, he said, implies that what keeps the Church perpetually sanctified is the true word of God.
							 “Anything outside this has the propensity to corrupt the Church and lead her astray,” he said.<br>

						Besides a core function of praying for the Church, the Women’s Ministry, which embraces all the womenfolk, is responsible for giving employable and vocational skills, and training in home management to the women. It meets on Tuesdays.

						The Women’s Ministry organises retreats, seminars, workshops, lectures and symposia in all spheres of life, including (i)
						marriage enrichment, wives’   responsibilities at home, child welfare, care and education (ii) 
						business management and techniques.

						It also carries out evangelism, counselling and sponsorship activities to help the needy in the church
						and in the society.

						Reading from John 13:34-35, Apostle Nyamekye said Jesus Christ himself stressed that the world
						has the right to decide whether Christians are true disciples of his, on the basis of the 
						love that believers show to all people. “It is this observable love among Christians 
						that will convince the watching world that God sent His Son to save humanity,” he added. (Jn. 17:21).

													The Youth Ministry takes care of the youth of the Church. 
													It meets on Mondays. Its students’ wing, called Pentecost Students and Associates (PENSA),
													operates in second cycle and tertiary institutions. It is vibrant in evangelism and leadership
													training.

							The Ministry carries out evangelism, i.e., preaches, witnesses and wins souls; encourages the youth to participate 
							fully in the programmes and activities of the Church and further exposes them to the various ministries within the Church


							It affords the youth the full opportunity to plan and organise programmes and activities for evangelism in schools,
							colleges and the tertiary institutions, and encourages them to develop their gifts and qualities of leadership,
							plan and organise programmes and activities that meet the peculiar needs and aspirations of the youth as well
							as carrying out other specialized Youth-related ministries.

							“As God’s people, God requires the entire Church to live their life as a fitting tribute to Him (1 Peter 2:9), reflecting His very character and nature. This image of the Church implies that as a people of God we cannot live our life the way we want it. God has interest in how we live our lives as the summoned-out group. The watching world too will measure us based on this understanding of the Church as God’s possession – a people that is required to simultaneously reflect God’s love and holiness.
