		<p> <big> Resurrection Of Jesus; A Well-Attested Fact In History – Chairman
			</big></p>

			<p>
				“That a man would lay down his life and take it back again is the
				 greatest miracle that has ever happened in history. The natural 
				 mind just cannot take it. As a result, it is also the most 
				 attacked because its consequences are far-reaching. 
				 It is life to many and death to some. The simple truth is 
				 that the resurrection of the Lord Jesus is a well-attested
				  fact in history.” <br>

				This was contained in a sermon delivered by the Chairman 
				of The Church of Pentecost, Apostle Eric Nyamekye, on the evening
				of Resurrection Sunday [April 4, 2021] as part of his weekly televised service
				
				on PENT TV dubbed ‘Sunday Special Evening Service With The Chairman’

			<p> <big> Duncan-Williams urges Christians to protect their relationship with God
				</big></p>
	
				<p>
					Archbishop Duncan-Williams gave the advice in his sermon on 
					Sunday at the Prayer Cathedral of the Action Chapel
					 International in Accra.

					Drawing lessons from life of Job in the Bible, the Archbishop said the Devil 
					wasn’t interested in Job’s children; declaring that his target was neither Job’s
					children nor Job’s riches or money.

					Archbishop Duncan-Williams said what the Devil wanted was Job’s relationship with
					God.
					This, he said, was because whether it was health or money, children or whatever 
					people had, but not everybody had a relationship with God.

					Archbishop Duncan-Williams said the Devil knows that if the believer’s
					relationship with God was intact, the believer could bounce back into glory.

		<p> <big> WARRIOR DIMENSIONS IN GOD’S KINGDOM – Apostle Mike Orokpo
			</big></p>

			<p>
				Warriors are fearless beings designed to face any adversity
				 in any territory. Akin to that, in God’s kingdom, warriors 
				 are sent in the days of God’s move in a land.


				“For God has not given us the Spirit of fear but power, 
				love and sound mind”
				There are four warrior dimensions God is bringing in our
				 land scape in form of horses

				1. The Race Horse:
				The dimension of this warrior horses carry the banner
				 of the kingdom of God and keep it in territories so that 
				 the emblem of Zion will stand tall as a land mark, that a 
				 new kingdom has emerged.
